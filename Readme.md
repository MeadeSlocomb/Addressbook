## Contact list - Backbone.js

This was my first project built using the Backbone.js.  The app takes basic information about an individual and stores that information in an easy to read, addressbook style format.  Entries are can be edited or deleted.

This app uses:

>Backbone.js </br>
>JQuery </br>
>Underscore.js </br>
>Handlebars.js </br>
>Font-awesome for icons </br>

The deployed project is visible here: http://development.meade-tiy-contactlistapp.divshot.io/
